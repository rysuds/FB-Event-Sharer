A Selenium Bot to auto-share a FB event to groups read out of a csv file

# Motivation
On the nights I moonlight as a standup comic and produce a few local shows in San Jose. I forund that marketing free shows on Facebook was a really good guerilla marketing technique to get people out to shows. I hated marketing to each group by hand so I hacked together a solution that reads the group names from a csv and auto shares the FB event to the specified group via selenium interaction w/ FB's UI.

The code is super hacky and could definitely use significant organizational and performance enhancements. I stopped working on it because FB eventually picked up on the repeated requests and got better at detecting the script. I may eventually revisit it and add some modularity and a custon UI for inputting cutsom prompts etc., but for now I'll upload it as a relic of a project I hacked together.
